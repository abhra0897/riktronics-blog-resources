I am Avra Mitra (Rik), a passionate embedded systems developer. I mostly love low level stuffs. Writing drivers for microcontrollers is super fun to me! I have graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Now I work full time as a software developer, but I still work on my personal projects when ever I have some spare time. 

I started my first blog [Riktronics.wordpress.com](https://riktronics.wordpress.com) for posting tutorials for complete beginners, but now my main goal is to just share my projects and experiments with you. I may or may not write beginners’ tutorials anymore.

Other than embedded systems, I really **LOVE** to learn about making game engines and rendering engines. I once wrote a bare-minimum rasterizer for microcontroller that could render, trnaslate, and transform a cube. There was no shading though. I also love to make 3D scenes using blender and unreal engine, but my knowledge is almost zero.

C is my favorite programming language. I am even writing a [GUI library](https://github.com/abhra0897/LameUI/) for embedded systems entirely in C. I also like C#, js, C++, and python.

Ubuntu (or Kubuntu) is my favorite Linux distro, KDE is my favorite DE. Approx 4 years ago I moved to GNU+Linux from Windows, and that was one of the best decisions in my life.

My inspiration for deep diving in embedded systems, ditching Windows for linux, and learning (and possibly using) advanced C was an extremely tallented youtuber - [***Charles Lohr (@CNLohr)***](https://www.youtube.com/user/CNLohr).
