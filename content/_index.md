#### Hi! Welcome to Riktronics

I created [my first blog](https://riktronics.wordpress.com) many years ago with one goal - to write tutorials for absolute beginners. But currently my main goal is to share my projects and experiments which are mostly about low level stuffs, writing drivers for MCUs etc. I still love writing tutorials, so, sometimes I may post beginner's tutorials here.

This blog is primarirly about embedded system, but I may write a few posts on my other side-projects which are not embedded systems. Like game development, writing rendering/game/physics engine from scratch etc.

Feel free to check the [posts](/posts), or find them by [categories](/categories). I would appreciate if you leave your thoughts in the comments of the posts.

Enjoy your stay here. Happy learning!
